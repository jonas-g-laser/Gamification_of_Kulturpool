Understanding and developing Gamification Concepts of the Kulturpool

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore the redesign and enhancement of the existing website "Kulturpool" to make it more appealing to a broader audience. 
The development focus is on improving user experience, adding new features, and optimizing the platform for accessibility and engagement. 
Through an analysis of the website conducted by the responsible parties from Kulturpool, 
the study will identify key areas for improvement and implement changes that address both aesthetic and functional aspects. 
The significance of this research lies in increasing the platform’s relevance and usability for a diverse range of users. 
As the project progresses, more detailed insights and findings will be incorporated into this overview.

## Similar Approaches

I have been looking for different ways to use gamification in museums. Three of these are listed here:

- [**Fortnite Holocaust Museum:**](https://www.staffs.ac.uk/news/2023/10/fortnites-new-in-game-holocaust-museum-shows-us-a-virtual-future-for-education) Fortnite’s new Holocaust museum, Voices of The Forgotten, offers a virtual educational experience about the Holocaust.
The museum, created by Luc Bernard, a prominent advocate for Holocaust education, features photographs and historical figures without graphic imagery.
Virtual museums in Fortnite and other platforms provide new opportunities for education, especially for young audiences, and may become a new frontier of learning.


- [**Spacebort and Museum of Fine Arts in Fortnite, Roblox and Metaverse:**](https://www.mfa.org/press-release/spaceport-partnership) The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, partners with Spaceport to license its art collection for use in popular games like Roblox and Fortnite. 
This partnership aims to democratize art appreciation by making iconic masterpieces accessible to a new generation of digital explorers. 
Through this collaboration, the MFA and Spaceport bridge the gap between art history and modern gaming, fostering a deeper appreciation for artistic expression.


- [**Museum in the Netherlands with Gamification:**](https://www.museumnext.com/article/new-museum-gamification-for-learning/) The Media Museum in Hilversum, Netherlands, has developed an educational app called Glitch to enhance student engagement during independent museum visits. 
The app, designed to navigate the evolving media landscape, uses an avatar to guide students through interactive exhibits and help them understand media culture’s impact on society.

## Use Cases

I also thought about different use cases in gamification for the Website itself.

### Children (8-12 years)

**Use Case:** Journey of discovery through a virtual gallery

- **Scenario**: A child visits the site to learn more about history and works of art, e.g. as part of a school project.
- **Interactions**: Easily navigable gallery views or 3D environment with guided control or fully remote tour to avoid problems, visual guides and collecting tasks like ‘Find the animals in the art.’
- **Gamification elements**: 3D tour of the museum; stickers or virtual badges for completed themes; quizzes at the end of each exhibition.
- **Evaluation:** Playful feedback options (e.g. an emoji ranking for fun factor and comprehensibility).

**Use Case**: Adventurous treasure hunt in a 3D museum

- **Scenario**: A child visits the website and starts a virtual 3D tour in which they have to search for certain ‘treasures’ in a historical museum.
- **Aim**: Children should playfully explore works of art and familiarise themselves with historical exhibits.
- **Interactions**:
    - *Interactive objects*: When the child comes across an object, he or she receives short, child-orientated information or small puzzle questions about the object.
- **Gamification elements**:
    - *Collect treasures:* Each time an object is found, the child receives a ‘reward’, e.g. a virtual stack of gold coins or a jewel.
    - *Achivement:* At the end of the tour, the child can add up all the treasures and receives a reward, such as a virtual treasure chest or a ‘Museum Treasure Hunter’ badge.
- **Evaluation**: After completing the tour, the child can give simple feedback (e.g. a thumbs up, stars or emojis) on how exciting they found the treasure hunt.

### Teenagers (13-18 years)

**Use Case:** Collection and Exchange of Favorite Artworks


- **Scenario:** Teenagers use the site for school research or as a hobby and want to create collections they can share.
- **Interactions:** Create personalized collections, quizzes on topics like art styles or periods, virtual avatars for community exchange.
- **Gamification elements:** Rewards for creating and sharing collections, participation in monthly art challenges. A 3D tour would also be appropriate here, though it wouldn't need to be guided since a certain level of technical knowledge can be assumed.
- **Evaluation:** Comment function or short surveys that encourage user activity and exchange.

**Use Case**: Art Historical Time Travel through a 3D Museum

- **Scenario**: A teenager visits the site to undertake a virtual 3D time travel journey through different art periods, starting from the Renaissance through to Modern art.
- **Goal**: Teenagers should develop a deeper understanding of various art periods and become familiar with developments in art.
- **Interactions**:
    - *Interactive Explanations*: Upon entering an era, popup information appears that briefly explains the artworks and their historical context.
    - *Timeline*: A timeline in the museum shows important art movements and changes. (an additional feature for the 3D museum)
- **Gamification Elements**:
    - *Rewards for "temporal milestones"*: Each time an era is explored, the teenager receives a digital badge, e.g., "Renaissance Explorer".
    - *Masterpiece Collection*: The teenager can save masterpieces in a virtual collection, which is displayed at the end as a personal portfolio.
- **Evaluation**: Feedback through a brief survey system (e.g., "What did you find most exciting?") or a star rating.

### Young adults (19 - 30 years)

**Use Case:** Discovery and Inspiration for Creative Projects

- **Scenario**: Young adults visit the site to find inspiration for their own creative projects, e.g., for art, design, or cultural events.
- **Interactions**: Advanced filters and personalized suggestions, social media integration, the ability to save favorite works in moodboards.
- **Gamification Elements**: Points for discovering new content, creative challenges (e.g., "Create your own artwork in the style of...") and badges for exploring different themes.
- **Assessment**: Likes or upvotes for content that is inspiring or "trendsetting," as well as brief feedback to evaluate quality and relevance for creative purposes.

**Use Case**: Curated Tour Through a 3D Museum Focused on "Inspiration for Creatives"

- **Scenario**: A young adult visits the virtual museum to find inspiration from famous artworks considered particularly influential, e.g., works by modern artists.
- **Goal**: Young adults should receive a curated tour that presents particularly inspiring works while providing ideas for their own creative projects.
- **Interactions**:
    - *Taking notes*: Users can add notes to artworks they want to view and save these notes as a source of inspiration.
    - *Virtual Moodboards*: During the tour, users can save artworks to a moodboard and download a PDF version at the end.
- **Gamification Elements**:
    - *Collector Levels*: Users can achieve "collector levels" based on how many artworks they add to their collection, e.g., "Inspiration Seeker" or "Creative Spirit".
    - *Badge for Complete Tour*: Completing the entire tour earns a virtual badge such as "Creative Curator".
- **Evaluation**: The tour concludes with a survey where users can indicate how inspiring they found the works. In this age group, this is likely to be done through detailed feedback and scoring (e.g., 1-10)

## Current status of the project

I was able to create a demo website based on the website [kulturpool.at](https://kulturpool.at) and integrated a Unity demo which is able to show different artworks and documents.
The website allows the user to explore the different files and artworks for the search term.
